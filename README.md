	If you want intrinsic value calculated based on PAST revenue and YOUR predicted revenue only, do the following:		
	1	On the DASHBOARD tab, enter the appropriate values into the yellow highlighted cells. Do not touch any other cells.	
		After typing in the stock ticker in lowercase, the spreadsheet will automatically pull info from the web and bring it to the DATA ENTRY sheet	
		The DFCF tab is where the calculations take place. If you want to see the calculations in a more organized format, please check the SIMPLIFIED tab.	
		You do NOT need to touch any cells besides the yellow cells on the DASHBOARD tab.	
			
	If you want intrinsic value calculated based on PAST revenue, YOUR predicted revenue, and ANALYST predicted revenue, do the following:		
	1	On the DASHBOARD tab, enter the appropriate values into the yellow highlighted cells. Do not touch any other cells.	
	2	On the DATA ENTRY tab, manually enter the analyste predictions for PERCENT INCREASE in revenue each year. 	
		Unfortunately, the website I was using to pull information started restricting access to analyst predictions so now we have to enter this part by hand :(	
		As an example, I have included the analyst projected percent increases in revenue for stock ticker DOCU.
